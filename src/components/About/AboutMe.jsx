          Back in 2019, I decided to code to cure my boredom because of the
          pandemic, then i got my hand first in HTML, CSS, and Javascript
          because of curiosity i had about how websites in the internet were
          made. That curiosity and eagerness to learn lead me to become one of
          the student of Universitas Sains Teknologi Indonesia.

          My main focus these days is building and practicing development of
          android application, then keep learning web development in the
          front-end side.

          When I’m not at the computer, I’d love to spend my time reading,
          drawing some art, or hangout with my fellow college friends to play
          video games.
